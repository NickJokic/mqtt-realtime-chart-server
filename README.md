# mqtt-realtime-chart-server

This project demonstrates the visualization of high-frequency data streams (50Hz+) with Rickshaw.js chart library! 

**mqtt-realtime-chart-server** is a **Express.js - MQTT - Socket.io** application, which works in conjunction with [mqtt-realtime-chart-client](https://github.com/NickJokic/mqtt-realtime-chart-client).

## Features
### Server
+ publishes and subscribes to MQTT topic (e.g. **voltage**)
+ forwards the received messages to the client using websockets


### Client
+ real-time data visualization with a multi-series line chart
+ dynamic slider which controls the chart render frequency (renders chart after N message(s))
	+ this is useful for optimization purposes, especially in high-frequency real-time streams, where you 	can	lower the chart render calls in order to lessen the CPU load. 



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you run the client, be sure you have these downloaded/installed on your machine:

+ node.js
+ npm
+ [mqtt-realtime-chart-client](https://github.com/NickJokic/mqtt-realtime-chart-client)
+ [Moquette (MQTT broker)](https://github.com/andsel/moquette) (or any other MQTT broker that listens on port 1883)
    + If using Moquette, be sure to have Java JDK installed (tested with JDK 8)

### Installing

To get started with this project, follow the 3-step installation, described here.

## 1. Moquette 

The following commands will unpack and run the Moquette broker, which listens on port 1883:

```
tar zxf distribution-0.10-bundle-tar.tar.gz
cd bin
./moquette.sh	
```

*Windows specific:*

```
cd bin
.\moquette.bat 
```


## 2. mqtt-realtime-chart-*server*  *\(this repo)\*

Navigate inside the root folder and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```
this will install the dependencies and start the express server locally on port 3000.

If the server-app and Moquette are already running in separate terminals, you can see the data stream inside the terminal. You can also check out the stream with a 3rd party MQTT client (e.g. MQTTfx) by connecting to **0.0.0.0:1883** and subscribing to topic **voltage**.


## 3. mqtt-realtime-chart-*client*

*Before running the client, be sure you have already completed steps 1 and 2, and have both Moquette and mqtt-realtime-chart-server running in separate terminal windows.*

Open a new terminal window and navigate inside the root folder of the client application, then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

After compilation, you will see the link in the terminal *(e.g. http://localhost:8081)* where the application is currently running. Use your browser to navigate to that link. 

If everything went smoothly, you should see a real-time chart with data frequency of around 50Hz.
